ViewEE is a software to view PCB layouts in various formats. Currently supported are Cadsoft Eagle .brd
and Kicad .kicad_pcb formats.

### Issues

Parser and renderer are not ideal. Some problems can be fixed (pad, via shapes),
some â€” not (I don't have an access to the eagle font). At current stage you will
definitely face problem with thru hole pad shapes. Kicad is tested on three `.kicad_pcb`
files only and probably there is more problems than with eagle format.

### Limitations

Currently only 2layer boards are supported.

### Reference rendering in version 0.2.0, [current version](/viewee/preview/)

### Mac OS X QuickLook plugin

You can install preview version of ViewEE for Mac OS X by downloading QuickLook plugin
from [releases page](https://github.com/cuwire/viewee.js/releases).

Download, unarchive, copy `.qlgenerator` file to the `~/Library/QuickLook/` folder.

## Thanks

Huge thanks to people who created the original version
for [Eagle board viewer](https://github.com/presseverykey/everywhere-eagle-viewer)
and inspired me to [fix some bugs](https://github.com/presseverykey/everywhere-eagle-viewer/issues/3) and create derived software.
